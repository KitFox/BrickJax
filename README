We've put together a script that we're hoping to get added to LEGO Answers that will allow users to 
easily insert images of Bricks, with or without links, and also links to sets on various listings 
sites via simple tags.

The supported tags are:

    [part:3700:4]
    Draw a part (Technic Brick 1 x 2 with Hole) in a colour (red).
    [partlink:3700:4]
    Draw a part (Technic Brick 1 x 2 with Hole) in a colour (red) and link to it on Peeron.com.
    [set:5590]
    Link to set 5590 on Peeron.
    [bl:5590]
    Link to set 5590 on BrickLink.
    [bs:5590]
    Link to set 5590 on BrickSet.

Enjoy
